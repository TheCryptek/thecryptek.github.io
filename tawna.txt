Dear Tawna, <!--laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag -->
<p>I love you, I truly do. I want to make you happy but I guess I dont... I apologize for that I really do.
But when I say I want to spend my life with you, that I want a family with you and that I want you to be my wife. I really and truley
mean that with all my heart and soul.</p><!--laglaglaglaglaglag-->
